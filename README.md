# boldFirstLetterOfWords
Makes the first letter of every word bold. Hopefully it makes it easier for dyslexics to read the text.

Inspired by [bionic-reading](https://bionic-reading.com/)

Usage, download the javascript file and add the following to a web page

    <script type="text/javascript" src="boldFirst.js" ></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    window.onload = () => { 
	     alterPage(); 
    };
    </script>
